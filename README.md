Question 1
I had a hard time trying to figure out how to keep my letter up while making a function for each row, so I may have went slightly off track, 
but I am still happy with the results

Question 4
For my initials, JM, I chose the flags of Jamaica, and Myanmar. I was originally going to go with Morrocco but I didn't want to just make the Jamaican flag,
with the Morroccan star on it. This was a very fun Assignment.
